# Setting up Mashery API Auth plugin for autonomous operation

This quick guide is for Mashery administrator and/or operators looking to get started with Mashery V2/V3 Access
Credentials Secrets Engine using a Docker container setup. The main benefit of Docker is that is provides a low-effort,
just-in-time access to the Mashery sensitive keys on the operator's device.

To set up Vault in the docker container, you would need:

- Basic knowledge of running shell scripts.
- A terminal capable of interpreting shell scripts. Windows-based hosts can either run WSL or Cygin
- Latest HashiCorp vault [installed on your machine](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/install) (so
  that `vault` command is accessible in the terminal)
- `jq` command
- a running Docker;
- an TLS certificate for your own Vault setup (highly advised; but can be skipped if you are in hurry)
- a strong pass phrase you can easily remember to secure sensitive vault keys

After following this guide, you will have:

- initialized Vault with Mashery secret engine enabled
- encrypted unseal script ensuring that only the operator can access the Mashery configuration
- obtained Vault-specific certificates to login

## Scripts location on your machine

You can copy the contents of this directory to the convenient location on your machine. It contains scripts and useful
templates that will be used during the setup. You may want to change the owner and change execution permissions on the
shell scripts to match the user that will be running these.

## Replacing bundled TLS certificate

The traffic to your Vault needs to be encrypted in transit. The default container is provided with a temporary
self-signed TLS certificate that supports host names `localhost` and `myvault.local`. Your system will not immediately
trust these certificates, and this is **expected**.

You are strongly encouraged to replace the bundled certificates with the ones that are specific to the machine where
you want to install. Method to create TLS certificates vary greatly and depend on many considerations. A good starting
point would be to use the services of major cloud providers, such as Azure KeyVault or AWS Certificate Manager.

To replace the TLS certificates, replace `vault-container.pem` and `vault-container.key` files containing the
certificate
and decrypted private key respectively e.g. using the following Dockerfile (see [`prepare`](./prepare) directory:

```dockerfile
FROM lspwd2/hcvault-mashery-api-auth:latest

COPY ./vault-container* /vault/tls
```

This Dockerfile can be built and run e.g. with the following command

```shell
$ docker build . -t my-mash-vault
```

Alternatively, if you are fine with using the bundled certificates, you could configure your system to trust it.

```shell

## Running Vault container behind NGINX
If you are planning to use your Mashery keys also do deploy Mashery APIs with Mashery terraform provider,
you *need* to run the Vault container behind NGINX that will perform necessary HTTP rewrites. The following
drawing illustrates the required deployment topology
![nginx topology](nginx-topo.png)

This topology requires:
- a bridging network (capable of routing connections from the host to the Internet)
- Vault container connected to the bridging network;
- nginx container that will be actually performing TLS termination and rewrite.

The compose file is found in the `mashauth-behind-nginx` directory. The source code does *not* contain
TLS certificate this connection should use. As a deployer, you need to provide `nginx.crt` 
and `nginx.key` files in the `mashauth-behind-nginx/nginx` directory. This is the certificate that nginx will
present to the `vault` client application, and which vault (and your system) should trust.

## Prepare the terminal session

The setup and operations in this guide are performed using CLI scripts. It is important to make sure that your terminal
session is prepared.

### Setting `VAULT_ADDR` variable

Ensure that the `VAULT_ADDR` is pointing to the correct host name. A sensible default is `https://localhost:8200/`,
which can be set with `export VAULT_ADDR=https://localhost:8200/`.

```shell
$ export VAULT_ADDR=https://localhost:8200/
```

### Specifying unseal file pass phrase

> **Unseal keys protection limitations**
>
> As a user of Vault, you need to be familiar with  [Vault seal](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/concepts/seal#seal-unseal)
> procedure. A production setup would require distributing the unseal keys to multiple people. This guide assumes that
> there will be a _single_ Vault operator. This makes unseal key distribution unfeasible.
>
> A viable solution to ensure that only device owner is able to unseal the Vault container is to encrypt
> critical data at rest. This data is termed *unseal keys*. The encryption requires the device owner to supply these at
> runtime.
> 
> Do not store this pass phrase in the clear on your device.
> 
> Also bear in mind that there is no way to recover this pass phrase if you forget it! Write the pass phrase e.g. 
> on a piece of paper and put it in a secure location.

The unseal file pass phrase protects unseal keys stored on disk of your device. These unseal keys can be used to get 
root access to Vault. Therefore, each time a root-level operation needs to be performed, the owner of the device
must supply the password. 

If you need to perform several root-level operations, you can add `HCV_SEALFILE_PASS` environment variable by
running the following command line:

```shell
read -s HCV_SEALFILE_PASS; export HCV_SEALFILE_PASS
```

## Starting and testing connection

Vault operation required IPC_LOCK capability ot run. This needs to enabled by passing `--cap-add=IPC_LOCK`
to the command line. 

```shell
docker run --cap-add=IPC_LOCK -p 127.0.0.1:8200:8200 lspwd2/hcvault-mashery-api-auth:latest
```

If you run Vault behind nginx proxy using the supplied compose file, you need to build local image and
run it as follows:
```shell
cd mashauth-behind-nginx
docker compose build
docker compose up -d 
```
> Note: the source code intentionally does _not_ include TLS certificates for the nginx container. So running the
> above-mentioned command on a checked out sources will probably _fail_ by design. You need to create
> certificate and a corresponding private key yourself (`nginx.crt` and `nginx.key`) and place these in 
> `machauth-behind-nginx/nginx` for the build to succeed.

## First-time setup
After you have started container for the very first time, you need to initialize your Vault 
before it can be used. This procedure needs to be done exactly once per lifetime of your container.

> Setup Tip
>
> If you are experimenting with the setup, up may want to include `--rm` options to the container startup. This way
> the container will be destroyed when finished. In case you won't include the `--rm` option, the container will
> create a volume at a Docker default location.

### Check uninitialized status

Before starting, verify that `vault` command is able to talk to your vault amd that `vault` trusts the TLS certificate
the container presents by running the following command:
```shell
$ vault status
```
which should output the following:
```text
Key                Value
---                -----
Seal Type          shamir
Initialized        false
Sealed             true
Total Shares       0
Threshold          0
Unseal Progress    0/0
Unseal Nonce       n/a
Version            1.13.1
Build Date         2023-03-23T12:51:35Z
Storage Type       file
HA Enabled         false
```

This indicates that you have a Vault that hasn't been initialized, and Vault trusts the TLS certificate the container
presents. 
> In case `vault` command doesn't trust the certificate, it needs to be added to the certificate trust store. This
> depends on the system where you are trying to run the scripts.

### Initializing Vault

In order to start using the Vault with Mashery authentication plugin, numerous steps need to be made. These are
automated in the [initialization script](bin/init_vault.sh) which will perform the required setup steps.

```shell
$ init_vault.sh
```
This script performs the following operations:
- initializes the vault seal and stores unseal keys in an encrypted file;
- registers and mounts Mashery authentication plugin
- issues TLS certificate for administrator authentication
- creates policy granting access to Mashery authentication plugin
- configured administrator entity and alias within Vault identity (see
  [this page](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/concepts/identity) for more information)
- creates AppRole role for running and authenticating Vault agents performing automatic logins

### Validating installation success

To validate that Vault has been successfully initialized, perform these steps. First, login into Vault as a 
administrator user:
```shell
$ ./vault_login.sh
```
Then, read default Mashery secret engine configuration by running:
```shell
$ vault read mash-auth/config/
```
The above command should print output analogous to the following:
```text
Key                        Value
---                        -----
enable_cli_v3_write        false
mashery issuer cert        n/a
mashery leaf cert          n/a
mashery root cert          n/a
net_latency (effective)    147ms
oaep_label (effective)     sha256:5a91e50bd79972682215d1a50e1c39565f293f9332c617afd62a49c86750ad69
proxy_server               n/a
proxy_server_auth          n/a
proxy_server_creds         n/a
tls_pinning (desired)      default
tls_pinning (effective)    default
```

If you see the output as above -- success! You have set up Vault, and it is ready for operation. Now you can add
the desired roles. Refer to [API documentation](../../doc/api/roles.html.markdown) to ceate your first role as well
as [how to import role data in pull mode](../../doc/pull_mode.html.markdown).

## Daily operations

### Unsealing
When you start a container where Vault that has previous been initialized, first step you need to unseal it by running
the `unseal.sh` script. 
```shell
$ ./unseal.sh
```
Once unsealed, the Vault can run for any extended period of time (e.g. several days, weeks or months)

### Logging into Vault. Logging out

The init script has configured a certificate-based login into vault. Run this script to receive a user token 
```shell
$ ./vault_login.sh
```
> If you have deployed Vault behind nginx, then this method will not work due to TLS termination performed
> at NGINX Instead use AppRole method to generate the token:
> ```shell
> ./vault_approle_login.sh
> ```

This command will create an access token to Vault that will be valid for 8 hours. After this time, the token will
expire. The remaining lifetime of the token can be obtained by running the command
```shell
$ vault token lookup
```
and examining the value printed in the `ttl` field.

You can renew the token any time by running the `vault_login.sh` script again.

> Security Tip
> 
> Although the access token is relatively short-lived, it is nevertheless a good habit to logout from Vault after
> you are done with the operation at hand. With Vault, logging out is achieved by revoking the Vault access token
> by running the following command: 
> ```shell
> vault token revoke -self`
> ``` 

### Interacting with Mashery Authentication plugin

After you have logged into Vault, you can interact with desired paths of the Mashery credentials secret engine via
`vault` read and write commands. Refer to the [documentation guides](../../doc)

## User certificate renewal

The certificates for the user logging into the Vault are valid for 7 days. After these expire, you need to re-issue
the user certificate again. The certificate rotation is performed using the following command:
```shell
$ ./rotateUserCert.sh
```
> Executing this command requires unseal key password. This is referred to as a requirement to ensure that no 
> session can run indefinitely without re-authentication. 

## Starting the Vault agent

Vault agent provides automatic **limited-time** authentication and authorization to use all Mashery secrets.
This can be a great help e.g. if you use Postman or you run application
performing a long-running process. For security considerations, the agent is allowed to operate for 8 hours
at a time. After this limit expires, the agent will become inoperative and will need to be re-started.

The vault agent is started using `start_agent.sh` script. The script requires access to unseal keys which requires
entering the unseal pass phrase. The unseal keys are used to generate a one-time secret identifier that Vautl agent
will use to authenticate itself. 

The agent will is listening on `localhost` and port 8100. 
> In this guide, the agent is listening on plain-text HTTP protocol. This setting may be sufficient to get started
> using Vault and Vault agent. Long term, however, you should obtain TLS certificate and implement these to ensure
> that all traffic to agent is adequately encrypted. Then you should modify the `listener` stanza of the
> `./agent/agent.hcl` file to include `tls_cert_file` and `tls_key_file` and set `tls_disable` to `false`.

You can verify that the agent is running and has successful authenticated by running the following command:
```shell
$ curl --location 'http://localhost:8100/v1/mash-auth/config/'
```
which should output the default Mashery secret engine configuration, similar to the following:
```json
{
    "request_id": "c0a8c273-575e-d3b0-b899-3371bfa00f69",
    "lease_id": "",
    "renewable": false,
    "lease_duration": 0,
    "data": {
        "enable_cli_v3_write": false,
        "mashery issuer cert": "",
        "mashery leaf cert": "",
        "mashery root cert": "",
        "net_latency (effective)": "147ms",
        "oaep_label (effective)": "sha256:68bb20104a76ece4de403ae81982d718077cf5233238cc8b103adcec6e382010",
        "proxy_server": "",
        "proxy_server_auth": "",
        "proxy_server_creds": "",
        "tls_pinning (desired)": "default",
        "tls_pinning (effective)": "default"
    },
    "wrap_info": null,
    "warnings": null,
    "auth": null
}
```
## Stopping Vault agent
Vault agent can be sopped stopped using `stop_agent.sh` script accordingly.

## What-next
If you have followed this guide, congratulations! You have a running Vault with Mashery secrets engine within your
Docker environment.
